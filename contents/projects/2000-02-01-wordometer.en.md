As people are encouraged to be physically fit by monitoring step counts, counting the number of words they read and giving feedback is a potential approach to helping them increase their daily reading volume."

We propose a system tracking the number of read words by analyzing eye movements measured by JINS MEME (commercial electrooculography glasses). As people are encouraged to be physically fit by monitoring step counts, counting the number of words they read and giving feedback is a potential approach to helping them increase their daily reading volume.
