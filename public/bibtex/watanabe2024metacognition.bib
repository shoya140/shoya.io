  abstract  = {Engagement is one of the core cognitive states in communication. Increased engagement improves the quality and immersion of the conversation. In this demonstration, we aim to present a metacognition augmentation application called Metacognition-EnGauge. This work aims to discover three research questions. Does self-metacognition augmentation of engagement levels support participant to be engaged in the meetings? Does group-metacognition augmentation of engagement levels support participant to be engaged in the meetings? Do participants prefer none, self, or group-metacognition augmentation intervention in the online meetings? To answer these questions, we conducted online meeting experiments with 18 participants. As a result, we found that self-metacognition augmentation outperformed well on increasing average engagement levels. According to the survey, participant preference shows group-metacognition as the best intervention.},
